## Code Journal:
Learning about objects and arrays has big a challenging process, and with W3 schools as a reference guide to turn back to for practical examples and exercises included it proved a little more helpful. 
Another helpful source that has been a good aid has been free code camp for the simplification of how arrays are described a s for each different need is required to manipulate, whether pop, push, slice, etc..
